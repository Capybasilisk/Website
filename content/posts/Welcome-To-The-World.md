Hello, and welcome to my blog!


I've made this site to document my journey in learning programming and AI.


I chose Python as my first language as it seems the most beginner friendly, especially for those of us from 
non-technical backgrounds. I'm also learning Linux and SQL, as both seem highly complementary to Python.


I set myself a bit of a challenge in that I decided to host the website on my own virtual Linux server. I reason that
this will quickly teach me some core sysadmin skills.


I hope to keep the blog updated with new projects, life permitting, so keep checking back!

I'm originally from Kenya, so a special hello to any East Africans reading this. :-)

Btw, the post title is from a 90s Fanta slogan I've always liked.
