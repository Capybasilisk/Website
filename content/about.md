#### A Kenyan Guy In London

I'm a hobbyist programmer currently working with a Linux/Python/SQL stack.


I got into coding to pursue my interest in artificial intelligence, particularly neuroevolution, the combination of 
neural networks and evolutionary computation. More broadly, I'm interested in search, optimization, and metaheuristic 
algorithms in general.


I was initially drawn to AI after learning about its use in materials science. The idea of novel chemical compounds
being discovered through an automated search in molecular space really struck a chord with me.

I love travelling and do so whenever I can. I really want to see Indonesia, French Polynesia and the Pacific in general.


If life doesn't get in the way, I'll try to update this blog as often as I can.
